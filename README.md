### Drug discovery

Predicting the properties of molecules or compounds is a fundamental problem in drug discovery

Each molecule is represented as a graph. Many data in this domain are graph-based (Molecules, biomedical knowledge graphs).

#### Problems

1. **Molecule properties prediction**
2. **De novo melecule design and optimization**
3. **Molecular Geometry Prediction**
4. **Retrosythesis reaction prediction**
5. **reasoning on biomedical knowledge graphs with applications in drug repurposing**
